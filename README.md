# Flight-Delays-Dashboard
This project consists of building data dashboards for visual representation using Tableau. 
The corresponding datasets document a variety of airline information including delays, cancellations, dates, and destinations.
The dataset is from 2015 for major airlines and airports.  The goal of the dashboards are to visualize which airlines have the most delays and potential causes.
This information could potentially be useful in the improvement and optimization of airlines, which could improve their branding, customer experience/satisfaction

## Insight 1
The number of cancelled flights from each area for each day:
From this map, we noticed that:
● California and Texas have a larger number of canceled flights with 33331, and 32612 canceled flights. 
● West Virginia had the fewest number of cancellations, only 103.
● We did the filter to count cancellation for eachmonth. 
● We tried to avoid any green or red shading issues which could affect color blindness, so we used an orange-blue color map.

## Insight 2
The sum of cancellation flights for each state per month:
● The map represents the geography of the data for each canceled flight and a further histogram gives clear stats of that region. 
● From this dashboard, we noticed that: For all days Texas has the largest number of cancellations with 668 flights.
● We tried to avoid any green or red shading issues which could affect color blindness, so we used an orange-blue color map.

## Insight 3
The sum and reasons of canceled flights:
● A pie chart is a circle that is divided into areas, or slices. Each slice represents the observed reasons for canceled flights with the total sum for each one over the year. Also, we designed the filter for each month if
someone needs to sum canceled flights and revise the cancellation reasons for each month separately.
● We tried to avoid any green or red shading issues which could affect color blindness, so we used colour-blind map. 
● From this pie chart , we noticed that there were 2397 canceled flights for Weather reasons, 1260 for Airline/Carrier,
and 779 for National Air System reasons, and we did not have any canceled flights due to Security.
